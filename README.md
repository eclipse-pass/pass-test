# pass-test

This repository contains any resources, scripts, artifacts etc. 
intended for use in testing of PASS. 

## Assets

The file assetsND.json.gzip is an NDJSON representation of the
assets taken from our minimal assets Docker image. It contains 
some actual assets from production, with users stripped out and
several test users created. The test users have been added in a 
way which preserves relationships to some grants, submissions,
etc. so that adding and changing entities and relationships can
be tested.

The NDJSON representation was generated by pulling all of the 
entities from a running pass-docker stack index; extracting the 
`_source` elements from each of the items in the result array; removing
the `JournalName_suggest` elements from these; adjusting remaining element 
names so that they do not begin with `@`.
